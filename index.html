					AeroSonic's investment journey in Republia began in 2000 when the government announced its plan to privatise Republian state assets, including airports.<br><br>

					Already successfully operating a number of other airports in the region, investment in Republia was a natural fit for AeroSonic's growth plan.<br><br>

					The privitisation of Republia's airpots was to happen in stages, beginning first with Niibata. Kawaya was to follow.<br><br>

					In 2002, AeroSonic secured the concession for Niibata. As we will come on to see, the Republian government's assurances relating to the concession for Kawaya and its assurances that it would encourage and protect foreign investment. Played a pivotal role in inducing AeroSonic to make its investment.<br><br>

					In the event, those assurances turned out to be worthless when in 2015, only half way in to its 30 year concession Republia went back on its word.

					Ther are three core aspects to Republia's conduct at issue.<br><br>

					First, ghosted AeroSonic, depriving it of the promised opportunity to bid for the Kawaya concession.<br><br>
					
					Second, Republia's failure to portect AeroSonic's investment when it knew there was a threat of harm by members of the public.<br><br>

					Third, The imposition of the International Airport Curfew Act which had a material negative impact on Niibata, and the subsequent imposition of fines under that Act.<br><br>

					Finally, the nail in the coffin, the unjustified termination of Aerosonic's concession to operate Niibata.

					Let's look at each of those in turn, beginning with the assurances given in relation to the Kawaya concession.

					From its very first interactions with Republia, AeroSonic had been enthusiastic about the
					opportunity to operate the Kawaya Internaitonal airport. <br><br>

					Even before it had been granted the Niibata concession, AeroSonic had expressed a strong interest in
					Kawaya. <br><br>

					Far from those suggesions going unrequited, from the outset, the Officials on the Republian side
					made clear commitments that AeroSonic would be invited to bid for Kawaya.<br><br>

					Indeed, during the negotiation of the Niibata concession, Mr Haneda, the CEO of the RIAC -- the
					state company repsonsible for awarding the concessions -- confirmed AeroSonic&#8217;s interest in
					Kawaya
					Airport "would of course be considered" and that AeroSonic "Would be invited to bid on the Kawaya
					Airport Concession"<br><br>

					Now, no doubt Republia will tell this tribunal that Mr Haneda was not the approrpiate person to be
					making that commitment. <br><br>

					Now, AeroSonic does not contend that the government was responsible for those protests. Rather, it is the government's failure to act that give rise to AeroSonic's loss.<br><br>

					Bowing to public pressure, and in complete disregard of the impact it would have on the operation of
					Niibata airport, the Republian government enacted the International Airport Curfew Act, which
					prohibited take offs and landings after 10pm.<br><br>

					Niibata was one of only two airports in Republia affected by the Act. Despite that, Republia did not consult with AeroSonic, either with respect to the Act itself, or the terms of the concession.<br><br>

					Quite apart from the financial damage the act inflicted on AeroSonic, it also put it in the untenable position of trading off compliance with the act with public safety, as indeed it was required to do under the terms of its concession.<br><br>

					So I begin with expropriation. We will see that international law has some recurrent features that
					come back under FET as well, so the second time I mention them, I will be faster.<br><br>

					Three successive propositions lead to the conclusion that there has been an unlawful expropriation:
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>first, you have to conclude that there was a taking; </li>
						<li>second, you have to conclude -- since the argument has been raised in defence -- that it was
							not immunised by the police powers doctrine; and </li>
						<li>finally, that the manner and the consequences of the taking were defective under
							international law. </li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
					So, if you'll allow me, I will outline the relevant legal questions of each of these three steps,
					before suggesting how they apply to the facts before us.<br><br>
					
					Case law including cases like Biwater Gauff and Tippetts v Iran show how a broad approach to what constitues a taking has
					been applied. <br><br>

					The BIT in this case, and international law generally, take broad approaches to what amounts to a
					"taking". The BIT protects against both expropriation and I quote Article 77(2) "any measure
					equivalent to expropriation or nationalisation". <br><br>

					Here, the IACA resulted in a significant depreciaion of the value of the investment AeroSonic hade made in Niibata, and the ultiamate termination of the Niibata concession stripped it of the investment entirely.

						First dealing with the defence of police powers. We acknowledge it has its place in
						international law. But it is critical -- and I cannot overemphasise it -- it's to be assessed
						with the rigour that international law demands.<br><br>

						Much of the discussion one reads about this doctrine is riddled with unacceptably vague
						proclamations about the legitimacy of a state's regulation. But a stated intention to act in the
						public interest is not enough. The legality of regulations requires more than that.<br><br>

						Fortunately, we have several authoritative statements of the legal conditions that a state must
						establish if it is to rely on the police powers and to interfere dramatically in an investors'
						rights. <br><br>

						So in Saluka, you have to have: "... non-discriminatory ... bona fide regulations that are aimed

						Methanex: "... a nondiscriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in

				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					Let's dwell a bit on proportionality. It's central to the present case with respect to both the
					expropriation chapter and the FET chapter.<br><br>

					Proportionality offers a balanced framework for analysing how a state conducts itself towards
					investors. It's a concept that involves three basic limbs, which have been helpfully summarised by
					Dr Bücheler in his monograph on Proportionality in Investor-state Arbitration:<br><br>

					"First, the relevant measure must be a suitable means to achieve a legitimate goal.<br><br>
					"Second, the chosen measure must be the least restrictive means to attain the relevant goal." That's
					obviously contextual; it's not an abstract statement that will allow you to decide every
					case.<br><br>

					"Third, the measure adopted must be proportionate in the narrow sense ..., which involves a weighing
					and balancing of the difference interests at stake."<br><br>

					[[Republia cannot seriously claim that a state has the discretion to act disproportionately, and that
					the word "discretion" cancels out the word "proportionality"; that measures could be, for example,
					unsuitable, more drastic than necessary, to make no attempt to mitigate harmful effects on
					investors. That's as much an offence to the English language and logic as it is to the current state
					of international law.]]<br><br>

					The tribunal in the Philip Morris v Uruguay case said that proportionality is an indispensable
					condition to the exercise of police powers. And I will -- as I will come back to -- say
					proportionality is also something that you examine in the context of FET claims<br><br>

					What previous tribunals -- like Saluka, Methanex, Philip Morris -- have clearly and consistently
					interpreted customary international law to set down is this: if the state's measures are found to be
					contaminated with bad faith, or by their discriminatory character or the lack of due process, or
					because they are disproportionate, the police powers doctrine doesn't apply. Any one of them; not
					necessarily bad faith infecting each one of the others.<br><br>

					In the present case, Republia's police powers plea fails on several of these grounds, as I will
					describe in a few moments. [END]

					But first, before the third feature of these relevant principles, before we consider their
					application, and this is a very simple point of looking at the EPA's requirement for an
					expropriation to be lawful. This will take less than a minute.<br><br>

					As with most BITs, Article 77 of the treaty in this case prohibits a state from expropriating an
					investment unless the measures are in the public interest, made with due process, non-discriminatory
					and accompanied by prompt, adequate and effective compensation. These conditions, which all must be
					satisfied if we get to this point of the decision-making tree, give rise to no difficulty

					So, application: how to evaluate Republia's conduct in light of these principles. This expropriation
					was a creeping
					expropriation, comprising a chain of conduct beginning with the imposition of the IACA and
					culminating in the
					baseless termination of the Niibata concession agreement that gives rise to the composite unlawful
					act that wiped
					out the AeroSonic's investment.<br><br>

					It cannot be the case, and it is not the case under international law, that a state can self-judge
					whether or not
					its actions constitute a compensable expropriation.<br><br>

					Recall the Methanex tribunal's injunction that the state's measures must be "enacted in accordance
					with due
					process". Here, Republia's police powers argument alone would fail by virtue of the complete lack of
					process that
					characterised its enactment of the IACA, and its revocation of the Niibata concession.<br><br>
