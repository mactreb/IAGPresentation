        <blockquote>“As defined by Judge Schwebel, ‘fair and equitable treatment’ is ‘a broad and widely-accepted standard encompassing such fundamental standards as good faith,
            due process, nondiscrimination, and proportionality’” <doc-cite><case>MTD v Chile</case>, para 109</doc-cite></blockquote>

        <blockquote>“[T]here is a growing body of arbitral law, particularly
            in the context of ICSID arbitrations, which holds that the principle of
            proportionality is applicable to potential breaches of bilateral investment treaty
            obligations …The obligation for fair and equitable treatment has on several
            occasions been interpreted to import an obligation of proportionality” <doc-cite><case>Occidential v Ecuador</case>, para 404</doc-cite></blockquote></blockquote>

        <blockquote>In Tecmed v Mexico, the tribunal applied a proportionality analysis and upheld a
                breach of FET where the State acted, inter alia, “without considering ways enabling
                it to neutralize or mitigate the negative economic effect of” its conduct. <doc-cite><case>Tecmed v Mexico</case>, para 164</doc-cite></blockquote>

    Turning now to Fair and Equitable treatment.<br><Br>

    The tribunal in Rumeli v Kazakhstan set down an authoritative list of princples that frame the FET standard:<br><br>
    "- the State must act in a transparent manner.<br><br>
     "- the State is obliged to act in good faith.<br><br>
     "- the State's conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or lacking in due process.<br><br>
      "- the State must respect procedural propriety and [again] due process."<br><br>

    To this list can, should, must be added the principle of proportionality.  <br><br>

    Numerous authorities have unsurprisingly accepted that for a state to act fairly and equitably, it needs to act proportionately.
