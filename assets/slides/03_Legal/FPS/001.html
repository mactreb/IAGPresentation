    Turning now to Fair and Equitable treatment.

    The tribunal in Rumeli v Kazakhstan set down an authoritative list of princples that frame the FET standard:
    "- the State must act in a transparent manner.
     "- the State is obliged to act in good faith.
     "- the State's conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or lacking in due process.
      "- the State must respect procedural propriety and [again] due process."

    To this list can, should, must be added the principle of proportionality.  

    Numerous authorities have unsurprisingly accepted that for a state to act fairly and equitably, it needs to act proportionately.
