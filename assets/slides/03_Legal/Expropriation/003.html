    Let's dwell a bit on proportionality. It's central to the present case with respect to both the expropriation chapter and the FET chapter.<br><br>		
    
    Proportionality offers a balanced framework for analysing how a state conducts itself towards investors. It's a concept that involves three basic limbs, which have been helpfully summarised by Dr Bücheler in his monograph on Proportionality in Investor-state Arbitration:<br><br>
    
    "First, the relevant measure must be a suitable means to achieve a legitimate goal.<br><br>
    "Second, the chosen measure must be the least restrictive means to attain the relevant goal." That's obviously contextual; it's not an abstract statement that will allow you to decide every case.<br><br>

    "Third, the measure adopted must be proportionate in the narrow sense ..., which involves a weighing and balancing of the difference interests at stake."<br><br>
    
    Republia cannot seriously claim that a state has the discretion to act disproportionately, and that the word "discretion" cancels out the word "proportionality"; that measures could be, for example, unsuitable, more drastic than necessary, to make no attempt to mitigate harmful effects on investors.  That's as much an offence to the English language and logic as it is to the current state of international law.<br><br>

    The tribunal in the Philip Morris v Uruguay case said that proportionality is an indispensable condition to the exercise of police powers.  And I will -- as I will come back to -- say proportionality is also something that you examine in the context of FET claims<br><br>

    What previous tribunals -- like Saluka, Methanex, Philip Morris -- have clearly and consistently interpreted customary international law to set down is this: if the state's measures are found to be contaminated with bad faith, or by their discriminatory character or the lack of due process, or because they are disproportionate, the police powers doctrine doesn't apply.  Any one of them; not necessarily bad faith infecting each one of the others.<br><br>

    In the present case, Republia's police powers plea fails on several of these grounds, as I will describe in a few moments. [END]
