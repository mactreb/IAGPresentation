    <h2>A broad approach to “taking” under the BIT and international law</h2>

        <li> “The Treaty encompasses not only direct expropriation (i.e. a formal Government taking) but also de facto or indirect expropriations which do not involve actual takings of title but nonetheless result in the effective loss of management, use or control, or a significant depreciation of value, of the assets of a foreign investor” <doc-cite><case>Biwater Gauff v Tanzania</case>, para 452</doc-cite></li>
        <li>“A deprivation or taking of property may occur under international law through interference by a state in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits, even where legal title to the property is not affected” <doc-cite><case>Tippetts v Iran</case>, p 225</doc-cite></li>

    So I begin with expropriation. We will see that international law has some recurrent features that come back under FET as well, so the second time I mention them, I will be faster.<br><br>

    Three successive propositions lead to the conclusion that there has been an unlawful expropriation: <br><br>
    <ul><li>first, you have to conclude that there was a taking; </li>
        <li>second, you have to conclude -- since the argument has been raised in defence -- that it was not immunised by the police powers doctrine; and </li>
        <li>finally, that the manner and the consequences of the taking were defective under international law. </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    So, if you'll allow me, I will outline the relevant legal questions of each of these three steps, before suggesting how they apply to the facts before us.<br><br>
    Case law including cases like Biwater Gauff and Tippetts v Iran show how this broad approach has been applied. 
    
    The BIT in this case, and international law generally, take broad approaches to what amounts to a "taking".  The BIT protects against both expropriation and I quote Article 77(2) "any measure equivalent to expropriation or nationalisation".
