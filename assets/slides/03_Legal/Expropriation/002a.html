First dealing with the defence of police powers. We acknowledge it has its place in international law. But it is critical -- and I cannot overemphasise it -- it's to be assessed with the rigour that international law demands.<br><br>

Much of the discussion one reads about this doctrine is riddled with unacceptably vague proclamations about the legitimacy of a state's regulation. But a stated intention to act in the public interest is not enough. The legality of regulations requires more than that.<br><br>

Fortunately, we have several authoritative statements of the legal conditions that a state must establish if it is to rely on the police powers and to interfere dramatically in an investors' rights. <br><br>

So in Saluka, you have to have: "... non-discriminatory ... bona fide regulations that are aimed at the general welfare ...".<br><br>

Methanex: "... a nondiscriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process...".<br><br>

[Philip Morris v Uruguay]: "... the action must be taken bona fide for the purpose of protecting the public welfare, must be non-discriminatory and proportionate ...".	<br><br>
