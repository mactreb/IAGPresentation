    But first, before the third feature of these relevant principles, before we consider their application, and this is a very simple point of looking at the EPA's requirement for an expropriation to be lawful.  This will take less than a minute.<br><br>

    As with most BITs, Article 77 of the treaty in this case prohibits a state from expropriating an investment unless the measures are in the public interest, made with due process, non-discriminatory and accompanied by prompt, adequate and effective compensation.  These conditions, which all must be satisfied if we get to this point of the decision-making tree, give rise to no difficulty whatsoever.  It is a simple and undisputed fact.  Republia has paid no compensation at all.<br><br>
